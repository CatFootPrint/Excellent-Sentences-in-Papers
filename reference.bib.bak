  Abstract                 = {Modulation type is one of the most important characteristics used in signal waveform identification and classification. Spatial correlation is a crucial factor for practical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper addresses the problem of blind digital modulation identification in spatially-correlated MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm is verified using higher order statistical moments and cumulants of the received signal. The purpose is to discriminate among different M-ary shift keying linear modulation schemes without any priori signal information. This study employs several MIMO techniques to identify the modulation with and without channel state information (CSI). The proposed classifier shows a high identification performance in acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.},
