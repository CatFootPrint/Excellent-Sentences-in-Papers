  Abstract                 = {Modulation type is one of the most important characteristics used in signal waveform identification and classification. Spatial correlation is a crucial factor for practical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This paper addresses the problem of blind digital modulation identification in spatially-correlated MIMO systems. The proposed algorithm is verified using higher order statistical moments and cumulants of the received signal. The purpose is to discriminate among different M-ary shift keying linear modulation schemes without any priori signal information. This study employs several MIMO techniques to identify the modulation with and without channel state information (CSI). The proposed classifier shows a high identification performance in acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.},

  Abstract                 = {Modulation type is one of the most important characteristics used in signal waveform identification and classification. In this paper, an algorithm for blind digital modulation identification for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is proposed. The suggested algorithm is verified using higher order statistical moments and cumulants of the received signal. A multi-layer neural network trained with resilient backpropagation learning algorithm is proposed as a classifier. The purpose is to discriminate among different M-ary shift keying linear modulation types and the modulation order without any priori signal information. This study covers different MIMO systems with and without channel state information (CSI). The proposed classifier is evaluated through the probability of identification where we show that our proposed algorithm is capable of identifying the modulation scheme with high accuracy in excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.},
